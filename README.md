# genexpr for VSCode

## Installation

Download the repository.

In VSCode go to Extensions then select "Install from .vsix"

Navigate to the repository folder and select the "genexprvs-0.0.1.vsix" file.

When you open a .gendsp file it should recognise the file type and give you syntax highlighting and some rudimentary code completion (via Snippets)

## Issues and Updates

Use at your own risk. I haven't touched this project for quite a while and won't be updating it.
